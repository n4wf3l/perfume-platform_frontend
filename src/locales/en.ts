      q2: "Are your perfumes authentic and of high quality?",
      a2: "Yes. Our perfumes are inspired by renowned niche fragrances, selected for their elegance and character. We work with serious laboratories and quality essences to offer you long-lasting, faithful, and accessible perfumes, without compromising on emotion.",
      q3: "Can I order a sample before buying?",

      q6: "Can I return a perfume if I change my mind?",
      a6: "Yes, as long as the bottle is new, unopened, and in its original packaging. You have 14 days to change your mind, as we want your purchase to be a pleasure, never a pressure.",
      q7: "How are the perfumes packaged?",
      a7: "With great care. Each perfume is protected and presented in a simple yet elegant packaging. Opening the package should already be a little emotion.",
      q8: "Do you offer gift cards?",
